Given a text, learn the vocabulary in it

- app to learn the vocabulary in a text. Given a text, finds all the lemmas (Wiktionary scrapper (https://github.com/Suyash458/WiktionaryParser)? Perseus? other tools Gogglable like https://outils.biblissima.fr/en/eulexis/index.php), lists most common words, and can quiz user on the vocab. It can let the user pick if they want to be quizzed on the ones they got right, or just the ones they haven't. Maybe have it work with French too (English? takes a long test and gives the least common words)
